	/* Watch out, this is really messy (see AppleIntelFramebufferController::MapFBToPort).
	 * I am not fully sure why this exists, and recommend setting index to array index (i.e. the sequential number from 0).
	 *
	 * The only accepted values are 0, 1, 2, 3, and -1 (0xFF). When index is equal to array index the logic is simple:
	 * Port with index    0    is always considered built-in (of LVDS type) regardless of any other values.
	 * Ports with indexes 1~3  are checked against type, HDMI will allow the use of digital audio, otherwise DP is assumed.
	 * Port with index    0xFF is ignored and skipped.
	 *
	 * When index != array index port type will be read from connector[index].type.
	 * Say, we have 2 active ports:
	 * 0 - [1]     busId 4 type LVDS
	 * 1 - [2]     busId 5 type DP
	 * 2 - [3]     busId 6 type HDMI
	 * 3 - [-1]    busId 0 type Dummy
	 * This will result in 2 framebuffers which types will be shifted:
	 * 0 - busId 4 type DP
	 * 1 - busId 5 type HDMI
	 * In fact BusId values are also read as connector[index].busId, but are later mapped back via
	 * AppleIntelFramebufferController::getGMBusIDfromPort by looking up a connector with the specified index.
	 * The lookup will stop as soon as a special marker connector (-1) is found. To illustrate, if we have 2 active ports:
	 * 0 - [1]     busId 4 type LVDS
	 * 1 - [2]     busId 5 type DP
	 * 2 - [-1]    busId 6 type HDMI
	 * 3 - [-1]    busId 0 type Dummy
	 * The result will be 2 framebuffers which types and the second busId will be shifted:
	 * 0 - busId 4 type DP
	 * 1 - busId 6 type HDMI
	 * It is also used for port-number calculation.
	 * - LVDS displays (more precisely, displays with CNConnectorAlwaysConnected flag set) get port-number 0.
	 * - Other displays go through index - port-number mapping: 1 - 5, 2 - 6, 3 - 7, or fallback to 0.

	 * This is GMBUS (Graphic Management Bus) ID described in https://01.org/sites/default/files/documentation/intel-gfx-prm-osrc-hsw-display_0.pdf.
	 * The use could be found in Intel Linux Graphics Driver source code:
	 * https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/6481d5ed076e69db83ca75e751ad492a6fb669a7/drivers/gpu/drm/i915/intel_i2c.c#L43

	 * However, it should be noted that Apple identifiers are slightly different from Linux driver.
	 * In Linux 0 means disabled, however, for Apple it has some special meaning and is used for internal display.
	 * Other than that the values are the same:
	 * - GMBUS_PIN_DPC    (4)  HDMIC
	 * - GMBUS_PIN_DPB    (5)  SDVO, HDMIB
	 * - GMBUS_PIN_DPD    (6)  HDMID
	 * - GMBUS_PIN_VGADDC (2)  VGA until Broadwell inclusive.
	 * So basically you could use 4, 5, 6 for arbitrary HDMI or DisplayPort displays.
	 * Since 5 supports SDVO (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Digital_Video_Out), it may also be used to support DVI displays.
	 * Starting with Skylake VGA works via SDVO too (instead of a dedicated GMBUS_PIN_VGADDC id).
